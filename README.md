# Hugging Face's LLMs Tokenizer and Inference Performance Test

Created By Charunthon Limseelo - Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador

This repository is using for collecting all Jupyter Notebooks for showing how to test the new LLMs with checking the tokenization of Thai Language. In directory management, I designed to categorize on each company as the folder.

## List of Available Models Family
- 00 is for out-source or not the big tech company.
- 01 is for Google Deepmind's Gemma models family.
- 02 is for Alibaba Cloud's Qwen models family.

## Under construction
- 03 is for Meta AI's Llama models family.
- 04 is for Microsoft's Phi and MAI models family.
- 05 is for SCB10x's Typhoon models family

Other LLMs will come in this repository later once it released in Hugging Face.

## Environment Setup
There is no requirements to setup the environment. Only having Google Account that can be accessible for Google Colaboratory. For this repository, I've already prepared the environment for you with NVIDIA's Tesla T4 for running and inferencing the model. Warning you guys that do not forget to disconnect and delete the runtime after using it.
