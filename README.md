# LLMs Tokenizer and Inference Performance Test

Created By Charunthon Limseelo

This repository is using for collecting all Jupyter Notebooks for showing how to test the new LLMs with checking the tokenization of Thai Language. In directory management, I designed to categorize on each company as the folder.

- 00 is for out-source or not the big tech company.
- 01 is for Google Deepmind's Gemma models family.
- 02 is for Alibaba Cloud's Qwen models family.

Other LLMs will come in this repository later once it released in Hugging Face.
